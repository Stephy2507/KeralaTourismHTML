                <p> Falling from 80 feet is a spectacular waterfall called ‘Athirapally’, located in the city of the
                    same name, 60 kilometres from Thrissur district of Kerala. Designing its way through the Anamudi
                    Mountains, this breathtaking cascade of foamy and bubbly waters is repeatedly called the Indian
                    Niagara Falls. The city of Athirapally is more than just that, as there are many places to visit
                    near Athirapally Waterfalls. The luxuriant greens of the Vazhachal forest, the unbounded Arabian
                    Sea, the frothy milky white water from the waterfalls, and the cobalt blue sky make this place a
                    perfect escape from the regular hustles of life.</p>

                <center><img src="./images/bekal-for-kasaragod.jpg" alt="Bekal Fort"> </img> </center>

                <p> Kasaragod boasts of the largest and best preserved Fort in the whole of Kerala, bordered by a
                    magnificent beach. Shaped like a giant keyhole, the historic Bekal Fort was built in the 17th
                    century. This historic monument offers a superb view of the Arabian Sea from its tall observation
                    towers, which were occupied by gigantic cannons till afew centuries ago.

                    Near the Fort is an old Mosque that is said to have been built by Tipu Sultan of Mysore. Originally
                    constructed by the rulers of the ancient Kadampa Dynasty, the Fort changed hands over the years to
                    the Kolathiri Rajas, the Vijayanagara Empire, Tipu Sultan and finally, the British East India
                    Company.

                    Today, the Bekal Fort and its scenic surroundings are fast becoming an international tourist
                    destination and a favourite shooting locale for film makers.</p>

                    </img> </center>

                <p> Munnar, the famed hill station of south India, is a romantic locale where natural beauty is
                    everywhere to visit, explore and to enjoy. Munnar is situated at the confluence of three mountain
                    streams – Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala – and the word ‘Munnar’ means three rivers in
                    Malayalam. Situated about 1600m above sea level, the hill station had been the summer resort of the
                    British Government during the colonial era. Imprints of the colonial past stand tall in the Munnar
                    town in the form of English country cottages. Virgin forests, savannah, rolling hills, scenic
                    valleys, numerous streams, huge splashy waterfalls, sprawling tea plantations and winding walkways
                    are all part of the great holiday experience on offer for a traveler to Munnar. Munnar is also known
                    for Neelakurinji, a rare plant which flowers only once in twelve years. The ‘kurinji season’ in
                    Munnar is a magnificent sight when the hills and valleys get bathed in the blue of the Neelakurinji
                    blooms.</p>

                <h3><i>5.Varkala</i></h3>
                <center><img src="./images/varkala-tourist-places-in-kerala.jpg" alt="Varkala"> </img> </center>

                <p> Varkala, a calm and quiet hamlet, lies on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram district. It has
                    several tourist attractions that include a beautiful beach, a 2000-year-old Vishnu Temple and the
                    Ashramam - Sivagiri Mutt a little distance from the beach.

                    The Papanasam Beach (also called as Varkala Beach), which is ten kilometers away from Varkala, is
                    renowned for a natural spring. Which is considered to have medicinal and curative properties. A dip
                    in the holy waters at this beach is believed to purge the body of impurities and the soul of all
                    sins; hence the name 'Papanasam Beach'.

                    A two thousand-year-old shrine the Janardhanaswamy Temple stands on the cliffs overlooking the
                    beach, a short distance away. The Sivagiri Mutt, founded by the great religious reformer and
                    philosopher Sree Narayana Guru (1856 - 1928) is also close by. The Samadhi (the final resting place)
                    of the Guru here attracts thousands of devotees every year during the Sivagiri Pilgrimage days -
                    30th December to 1st January. Sree Narayana Guru propagated the ideology: "one caste, one religion
                    and one God", in a society torn by the taboos of caste system.

                    Varkala offers excellent accommodation facilities for tourists and is fast becoming a popular health
                    resort with many Ayurvedic massage centres.</p>

                Kerala, located on the south-western tip of India, enjoys unique geographical features that have made it
                one of the most sought-after tourist destinations in Asia. Fondly referred to as <i><u>‘God’s Own Country’</u></i>,
                Kerala was selected by the National Geographic Traveller as one of the 50 destinations of a lifetime and
                one of the thirteen paradises in the world.

                An equable climate, serene beaches, tranquil stretches of backwaters, lush hill stations and exotic
                wildlife are the major attractions of this land. A unique advantage of Kerala is that most of the
                destinations here are only a two - four hour drive from the other.

                Classical art forms, colourful festivals, exotic cuisine are some of the cultural marvels that await
                travellers. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine and Panchakarma, the rejuvenation therapy in
                Ayurveda have also helped Kerala to gain a pan-global reputation as a worth-visit destination.

                Season never ends in Kerala, thanks to the year-long moderate climate and numerous festivals and events.
